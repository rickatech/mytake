SETUP

index_sample.php provide rough template for how calls can be made to
mytake functions.  It does require article catalog file with references
to pre-loaded imags (beyond the scope of this version to provide
secondary samples of those ... for now).


TO DO

If there is no bog, then don't present a link.

Build equivelnet tag lists for Read, Tunes, Flicks, WTF

Make all tag words links to record matching page.  Or at least
major tags are links

On fully article view, insert the title and byline from data record,
also list the tags on the top
