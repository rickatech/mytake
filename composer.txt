In the same folder that contains composer.json run 

$ composer install

  [ this should download/install mobile-detect, michelf, ...  in the vendors folder ]


Reset

$ rm composer.lock; rm -fr vendor


PHP version 5.5.0 >= does need the extra include in setup/profile/index.php,
but it shouldn't hurt if it is loaded anyway.
