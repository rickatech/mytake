 2) In parent of vhost target folder ...

    $ git clone https://github.com/rickatech/mytake

    $ git clone https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect

      [ mytake currently depends on this passive library ]

    $ git clone https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown

 2) Prepare site tutorial configuration files
